# Templates for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence tasks

## Introduction

This repository contains some templates for different data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence tasks using popular Python packages such as scikit-learn < https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ >, TensorFlow < https://www.tensorflow.org/ >, or Keras < https://keras.io/ >.

They build on Aurélien Géron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" < https://www.google.de/books/edition/Hands_On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit_Le/HnetDwAAQBAJ >, Andrew Ng's courses on Coursera < https://www.coursera.org/ >, or the documentations of the respective packages.

These templates are at a very early stage and will be added to or updated over time. Their main purpose is to obtain more hands-on experience with these tools in order to complement my predominantly theoretical knowledge about them. None of this is tuned for performance.

## Classification

### Binary classification

Binary classification with random forests and gradient boosting using the Titanic data set as example.

### Multiclass classification

Multiclass classification with an NN and a CNN using the MNIST data set as example.

### Pretrained models

Using pretrained models and transfer learning for classification with the flowers data set as example.

## Regression

Regression with linear regression and random forests using the California housing prices data set as example.

## Clustering

Clustering with k-means and DBSCAN using the Iris data set as example.

## Anomaly detection

Anomaly detection with Gaussian mixture models, PCA, and isolation forest using the breast cancer Wisconsin data set as example.

## Still missing
