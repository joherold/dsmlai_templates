# Templates for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence tasks

## Introduction

This repository contains some templates for different data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence tasks using popular Python packages such as scikit-learn < https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ >, TensorFlow < https://www.tensorflow.org/ >, or Keras < https://keras.io/ >.

These templates are work in progress and build on Aurélien Géron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" < https://www.google.de/books/edition/Hands_On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit_Le/HnetDwAAQBAJ >, Andrew Ng's courses on Coursera < https://www.coursera.org/ >, or the documentations of the respective packages.

Their main purpose is to obtain more hands-on experience with these tools in order to complement the predominantly theoretical knowledge about them.

## Classification

Classification with random forests and gradient boosting using the titanic data set as example.

## Regression

Regression with linear regression and random forests using the California housing prices data set as example.

## Clustering

Clustering with k-means and DBSCAN using the Iris data set as example.

## Anomaly detection

Anomaly detection with Gaussian mixture models using the breast cancer Wisconsin data set data set as example.

## Still missing

* Pipelines
* TensorFlow and Keras
* Deep architectures such as neural networks, transformers, etc.
* Reinforcement learning
* Combining mechanistic and data-driven models such as in PINNs
* ... and a lot more
